    "This [dataset](https://github.com/ZeningQu/World-Bank-Data-by-Indicators/tree/master/infrastructure) contains infrastructure indicators (e.g. number of fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 people, electrical power consumption per capita) for different countries and aggregate regions for different years through 2017. For simplicity I've focused on a single year as described below. Some wrangling and cleaning was done by Zening Qu.\n",

    "3. How does method of electricity generation vary worldwide, and is it related to the amount of electricity used?\n",

    "Breaking the data into quintiles based on cell phone subscriptions shows that in general, countries with lower rates of mobile phone usage have lower internet usage and broadbrand subscriptions rates. However, there is still significant variability in these variables with respect to mobile phone usage. Countries with high internet access rates compared to broadband subscriptions don't consistently have particularly high rates of cell phone usage, so folks using the internet in those places may be accessing the internet in other ways (internet cafes, public libraries, etc.). In other words, there doesn't seem to be clear evidence supporting our hypothesis that higher cell phone ownership is associated with the combination of high internet access and few broadband subscriptions.\n",

This dataset includes metrics for oil, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, and coal generation, so a stacked bar chart seems like a good way to look at the breakdown for each country. To just get an overview of the data, we don't need to know which country is which, so we will make the bars compressed and remove the country names. We will also filter out all zero values, which will omit any countries which list 0 generation for all five categories (more likely missing data points than countries getting energy entirely from sources outside these categories)."

It could be that these countries get lots of energy from sources not included here (such as wind or solar), or these could be gaps in the data. There's no way to know which based on this dataset.\n",
